# GeoJSON Earthquake Data Leaflet Challenge
<br><br>
Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short. The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.
<br><br>
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

<b>Visualizations</b>
<br>
Got the data set and imported & visualized the data by creating a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
<br>
Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. Popups are included that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. A legend was created to to provide context.
<br><br>
<b>More Data</b>
<br>
The USGS also requested a second data set plotted on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
<br>
A second data set was plotted on the map. I also added a number of base maps to choose from and overlays that can be turned on and off independently for each separate data set.
